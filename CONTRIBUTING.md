## 💻 Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types when defining objects
- Avoid using `any` - use proper type definitions
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use type imports/exports appropriately
- Follow existing type patterns in the codebase

### Component Guidelines

- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Follow React Server Components patterns where appropriate
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Add appropriate error handling and error boundaries
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1)

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the established design system
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes
- Ensure dark mode support for all components

## 🔀 Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - production-ready code
- `develop` - integration branch for features
- `feature/xyz` - individual feature branches
- `fix/xyz` - bug fix branches

### Commit Message Format

Follow this format for commit messages:

- **fix:** for bug fixes (e.g., "fix: resolve authentication timeout issue")
- **feat:** for new features (e.g., "feat: add sales filtering by date range")
- **perf:** for performance improvements (e.g., "perf: optimize dashboard queries")
- **docs:** for documentation changes (e.g., "docs: update installation instructions")
- **style:** for formatting changes (e.g., "style: format code according to styleguide")
- **refactor:** for code refactoring (e.g., "refactor: extract sales logic to custom hook")
- **test:** for adding missing tests (e.g., "test: add unit tests for sales calculations")
- **chore:** for maintenance tasks (e.g., "chore: update dependencies")
